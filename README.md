<h1 align="center"> Covid19 Data Exploration using SQL Queries on SSMS Platform</h1>

<p> Covid19 Data Exploration is a Project wherein I took the dataset from Our World In Data which comprises of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths. The main focus of this project was to showcase the utilization of Joins, CTE's (Common Data Expressions), Temporary Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Views, and Converting to Data Types. The file was downloaded as a CSV file and changes were made to create two tables namely Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations. The focus was mainly target to understanding the amount of deaths per continent, country and the vaccinations utilized in these continents/countries. <p>
